# Pixels Steering Behavior

We will to explore a application of Steering Behaviors (By, Craig Raynolds, 1982). In resume, we call Vehicles any particules that will be a Steering Behavior. Any Vehicles will be a object that atributes are:

- Position
- Velocity
- Acceleration 

We use OpenCv to read image like a np.array, then we use grayscale to determines the radius of each particules in simulation. There is two differents forces: Repulsion and seek. 

- Seek: Atraction by initial position
- Repulsion: The mouse pointer will push particules (for all distance smaller than "D")

# Application:

We use a image for this presentation and we use our code to transform some pixels in a Vehicle. 

> The input will be a image below (The most beatiful girl I ever met):
<img src="assets/alexia.png" alt="The most beatiful girl I ever met" width="300"/>

> The transform will be this (note that we not convert all the pixels in Vehicles):
<img src="output/00001_screenshot.png" alt="Input" width="300"/>
<!-- ![Input](output/00001_screenshot.png) -->

> Finally, we will create this video with our simulation:
<img src="alexia_steer.gif" alt="Results" width="300"/>
<!-- ![Results](alexia_steer.gif) -->

# To Run:

First, clone this repository, enter in your directory and run this comand line:

```terminal
> python main.py assets/alexia.png
```

You will see the simulation above with image I provide. However, if you want simulate with another image, just use path of the your image instead of "assets/alexia.png" and voi a la! Very much simple.
